# ðŸ‘‹Hi
**RCONnector** was a small project I did **2020**.
The goal was to create a working implementation of the [RCON](https://wiki.vg/RCON) protocol in **Java**.
It also served as a nice introduction to some networking basics and packet building.

# ðŸ“” Usage
Incorporate the `RCONnector.java` file in your own project to use it.
